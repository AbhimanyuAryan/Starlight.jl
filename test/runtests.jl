            there are no test cases for them in the book, and it made
            this chapter a lot trickier. other interesting bits included
            having to multiply ϵ by 100000 before the fleas would go away,
            and having to mess with a bunch of stuff from the last chapter
            rather than just cleanly layering on new functions.

            this chapter involves refactoring sphere so you can accomodate
            it and the new plan class more easily via an abstract shape class.
            that's half or more of the chapter, or at least of the work
            involved, since the plane is a really simple primitive.

            the affected functions are ==, transform!, material!, intersect,
            and normal_at, and those are the *only* affected functions (i.e.
            the only places where changing sphere changes other code
            requirements).

            another change worth investigating is how many of my mutable structs
            could be made immutable with some refactoring.

            ...ok going by the docs, probably none of these should be immutable,
            or at least it probably won't hurt anything if they're all mutable.
            however, material! and transform! don't really help anyone do anything,
            so i removed them and refactored a bunch of the constructors to use
            keyword arguments. also i stopped hard-assigning world array fields
            in favor of push!ing. then i refactored the test to remove the == operator
            in favor of testing all the interesting fields individually, and removed
            those overloads from the module. not going to miss them, they were a
            hassle.

            that means the only things i'll need to truly refactor for this chapter
            will be intersect, normal_at, and perhaps constructors. going to take
            a break and think about this a bit, because julia doesn't allow abstract
            classes to have fields, nor inheriting from concrete classes, so the
            usual approaches won't work.

            was in refactoring mode and removed the x,y,z,w,x!,y!,z!,w! functions,
            they were more trouble than they were worth. replaced wrld with w.

            well it turns out that not only does julia not allow abstract classes
            to have fields, it doesn't really allow abstract classes at all, only
            abstract classes, which are more a dispatch tool than a way to not
            repeat common code. so i'm not going to have an abstract shape class,
            and will skip the tests related to that because the simple changes i
            made to ease dispatching with multiple shapes don't break any of the
            existing tests.

            then removed sphere's origin field because it was never used anywhere,
            and realized that a sphere is just a thing with a transform and a material
            that has a certain meaning for intersection and normal calculations.
            dunno if i can clean things up further. probably would be a good
            question for humans of julia.

            planes were super easy to add after all that was dealt with, but i
            do want to see about maybe refactoring them later.
